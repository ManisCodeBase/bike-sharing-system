## General Information
- Background: The rising popularity of shared bikes as a sustainable and convenient mode of transportation requires effective demand forecasting to optimize bike availability.
- Business Problem: The key challenge is to accurately predict the number of bike rentals, which helps in efficient resource allocation and better customer service.
- Dataset: The dataset includes features such as weather conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, time of the day, and holiday status. This data is utilized to forecast the bike rental demand.

## Technologies Used
- Pandas - version 1.3.3
- NumPy - version 1.21.2
- Matplotlib - version 3.4.3
- Seaborn - version 0.11.2
- Scikit-learn - version 0.24.2

## Conclusions
- Key Factors Influencing Demand: Weather conditions, particularly temperature and humidity, significantly affect bike rental rates.
Peak Demand Times: Demand peaks during certain hours of the day, highlighting the importance of time in predicting rentals.
- Holiday Effect: There is a noticeable difference in demand on holidays compared to regular days, indicating that holiday status is a crucial feature.
- Model Performance: The multiple linear regression model provides a good fit, explaining a significant portion of the variance in bike demand.
